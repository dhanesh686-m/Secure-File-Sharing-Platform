# Secure File Sharing Platform

This is a Flask-based web application that provides a secure way to share files. It allows users to register, upload files, and generate shareable links with optional expiration dates and download limits. All uploaded files are encrypted at rest using a file-specific key, which is itself encrypted by a master key.

# Key Features

  User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.

  File Uploads: Users can upload files to the platform.

  End-to-end Encryption: All files are encrypted using a unique key before being saved to the server's disk.

  Secure Sharing Links: Generate unique, shareable links with customizable expiration and download limits.

  File Management: Users can view and delete their uploaded files and associated share links.
